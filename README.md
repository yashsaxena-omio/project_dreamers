Executive Summary:

Experiment "dreamers-v3", started in the last week of Oct 2022, was conducted for IOS users, whose detailed analysis can be found here (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UHxvXuR3PHI-7MmOOdjxfRknmR8Iwnk7F6hUjw1XNXw/edit).
The relative uplift / observed difference in conversion rate between the test and control groups isn't big enough to declare a significant winner for both users and customers.
Also, this analysis did not include if the client interacted with "Explore Tab" or the "Destinations" recommended in explorer tab drove the bookings, so based on our mutual discussion on the outcomes, we decided to analyse the engagement with "Explorer Tab" and also the "Destination" level conversions.

Since there were some fixes made to the Explorer Tab, new experiments were launched in the last week of Nov 2022, so the next set of analysis was carried out for the experiment "dreamers-v4" for IOS and "dreamers-android-v1" for Android, whose detailed analysis can be found here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qwB0p00bv0X0Sau6OmP0rZpYCush226HNJLZ6ub6v9c/edit#gid=0).
The engagement with the "Explorer" tab is approximately 11%-12%, while 1.5%-2% approximately explore the "Destination-cards" and less than 1% are searching the destinations explicitly after seeing them on the "Explorer" tab for both Android and IOS.
